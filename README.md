# Pomodoro Clock Focus

This is a passion project of mine. Staying focus was tuff so I build this Pomodoro timer,
where you can set a time you want to fucus fully on then enjoy your break, Then work again no need to look at
the timer as the inbuild sounds will tell you. This was a need based project of mine.
